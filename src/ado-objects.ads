--  == Objects ==
--  When a database table is mapped into an Ada object, the application holds a reference
--  to that object through the `Object_Ref` type.
--  The `Object_Ref` tagged type is the root type of any database record reference.
--  Reference counting is used so that the object can be stored, shared and the memory
--  management is handled automatically.  It defines generic operations to be able to:
--
--    * load the database record and map it to the Ada object,
--    * save the Ada object into the database either by inserting or updating it,
--    * delete the database record.
--
--  The Dynamo code generator will generate a specific tagged type for each database table
--  that is mapped.  These tagged type will inherit from the `Object_Ref` and will implement
--  the required abstract operations.  For each of them, the code generator will generate
--  the `Get_X` and `Set_X` operation for each column mapped in Ada.
--
--  Before the `Object_Ref` is a reference, it does not hold the database record itself.
--  The `ADO.Objects.Object_Record` tagged record is used for that and it defines the
--  root type for the model representation.  The type provides operations to modify a
--  data field of the record while tracking its changes so that when the `Save` operation
--  is called, only the data fields that have been modified are updated in the database.
--  An application will not use nor access the `Object_Record`.  The Dynamo code generator
--  generates a private type to make sure it is only accessed through the reference.
--
--  Several predicate operations are available to help applications check the validity
--  of an object reference:
--
--  | Function    | Description |
--  | ----------- |--------------------------------------------------------- |
--  | Is_Null     | When returning True, it indicates the reference is NULL. |
--  | Is_Loaded   | When returning True, it indicates the object was loaded from the database. |
--  | Is_Inserted | When returning True, it indicates the object was inserted in the database. |
--  | Is_Modified | When returning True, it indicates the object was modified and must be saved. |
--
--  Let's assume we have a `User_Ref` mapped record, an instance of the reference would
--  be declared as follows:
--
--    with Samples.User.Model;
--    ...
--      User : Samples.User.Model.User_Ref;
--
--  After this declaration, the reference is null and the following assumption is true:
--
--    User.Is_Null and not User.Is_Loaded and not User.Is_Inserted
--
--  If we set a data field such as the name, an object is allocated and the reference
--  is no longer null.
--
--    User.Set_Name ("Ada Lovelace");
--
--  After this statement, the following assumption is true:
--
--    not User.Is_Null and not User.Is_Loaded and not User.Is_Inserted
--
--  With this, it is therefore possible to identify that this object is not yet
--  saved in the database.  After calling the `Save` procedure, a primary key is
--  allocated and the following assumption becomes true:
--
--    not User.Is_Null and not User.Is_Loaded and User.Is_Inserted
--
--  == Loading Objects ==
--  Three operations are generated by the Dynamo code generator to help in loading
--  a object from the database: two `Load` procedures and a `Find` procedure.
--  The `Load` procedures are able to load an object by using its primary key.
--  Two forms of `Load` are provided: one that raises the `ADO.Objects.NOT_FOUND`
--  exception and another that returns an additional `Found` boolean parameter.
--  Within the application, if the database row is expected to exist, the first
--  form should be used.  In other cases, when the application expects that the
--  database record may not exist, the second form is easier and avoids raising
--  and handling an exception for a common case.
--
--     User.Load (Session, 1234);
--
--  The `Find` procedure allows to retrieve a database record by specifying a
--  filter.  The filter object is represented by the `ADO.SQL.Query` tagged record.
--  A simple query filter is declared as follows:
--
--    Filter : ADO.SQL.Query;
--
--  The filter is an SQL fragment that is inserted within the `WHERE` clause to
--  find the object record.  The filter can use parameters that are configured
--  by using the `Bind_Param` or `Add_Param` operations.  For example, to find
--  a user from its name, the following filter could be set:
--
--    Filter.Set_Filter ("name = :name");
--    Filter.Bind_Param ("name", "Ada Lovelace");
--
--  Once the query filter is initialized and configured with its parameters,
--  the `Find` procedure can be called:
--
--    Found : Boolean;
--    ...
--    User.Find (Session, Filter, Found);
--
--  The `Find` procedure does not raise an exception if the database record is not found.
--  Instead, it returns a boolean status in the `Found` output parameter.  The `Find`
--  procedure will execute an SQL `SELECT` statement with a `WHERE` clause to retrieve
--  the database record.  The `Found` output parameter is set when the query returns
--  exactly one row.
--
--  == Modifying Objects ==
--  To modify an object, applications will use one of the `Set_X` operation generated
--  for each mapped column.  The ADO runtime will keep track of which data fields are
--  modified.  The `Save` procedure must be called to update the database record.
--  When calling it, an SQL `UPDATE` statement is generated to update the modified
--  data fields.
--
--    User.Set_Status (1);
--    User.Save (Session);
--
--  == Deleting Objects ==
--  Deleting objects is made by using the `Delete` operation.
--
--    User.Delete (Session);
--
--  Sometimes you may want to delete an object without having to load it first.
--  This is possible by delete an object without loading it.  For this, set the
--  primary key on the object and call the `Delete` operation:
--
--    User.Set_Id (42);
--    User.Delete (Session);
--
package ADO.Objects is

   --  The object was modified by a another transaction.
   --  This exception is raised by 'Save'.
   LAZY_LOCK    : exception;

   INSERT_ERROR : exception;

   UPDATE_ERROR : exception;

   --  The object record was not found in the database.
   NOT_FOUND       : exception;

   --  The object is NULL.
   NULL_ERROR : exception;

   --  --------------------
   --  Object Key
   --  --------------------
   --  The <b>Object_Key</b> represents the primary key for an object.
   --  It is composed of the key value and a class mapping identification.
   --  The key value can be an integer or a string and is saved in the database.
   --  The class mapping is used to know in which table the object is stored.
   --  In comparison and hashing, the class mapping is used to distinguish
   --  objects of different tables.
